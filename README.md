# AMICO-8
*AMICO-8* is a virtual console developed in *Retro Gadgets* (v0.1.8) that aims to create a *PICO-8*-like environment. The console comes with the *AMICHETTO-8* os that provides a bunch of useful functions to help develop applications for the console.

AMICO-8 has a 128x128 pixels display, 10 front buttons (arrows, letters, start and select), 4 back buttons (L1, L2, R1, R2) and 2 analogs (left stick and right stick).
